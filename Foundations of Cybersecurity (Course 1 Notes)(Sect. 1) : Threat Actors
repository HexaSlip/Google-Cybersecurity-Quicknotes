### Foundations of Cybersecurity (Course 1 Notes)(Sect. 1) 
  **Overall Concept**: Cybersecurity: the practice of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

### Threats in the Cybersecurity world:

**Key Term** **Threat Actor**: Person or group posing a security risk

üïµÔ∏è**External Threat**:
-Outside the organization
-Gains access to priv. information, networks, or devices
*Example: A hacker attempting a DoS attack on the company website*
**Most Likely Target:** Public-facing systems (websites, email servers, exposed APIs) 
**Likelihood: **Moderate**
**Difficulty to Defend:** Easier (firewalls, patching, IDS)

üè¢**Internal Threat**: 
-Accidental or Intentional 
-Inside the org( employees, vendors, partners)
*Example: An employee clicking a phishing email that installs malware*
**Most Likely Target:** Company email, shared drives, internal apps
**Likelihood:** High (human error is common)
**Difficulty to Defend:** Harder (insider access is trusted) 

üí° Tip: Internal Threats often stem from human error( i.e, clicking on a phishing email or link)

**Internal Actor**:
-Intentional
-Unauthorized data access
-Misuses systems for personal gain
*Example: A disgruntled employee steals customer data to sell online* 
**Most Likely Target:** Sensitive databases, trade secrets, financial records
**Likelihood:** Low-Moderate
**Difficulty to Defend:** Hardest (trusted access + malicious intent) 

üí° Tip: Internal Actors are dangerous since they already have access to the system and can easily move or leak data if given the opportunity.
